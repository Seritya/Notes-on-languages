Just started working on Unix. No idea what this acutally is... ^^
Was QueenWolf's idea (as often), she told us to enroll in: Coursera.org/learn/unix/
We'll see. First I had to install a ton of stuff to have Ubuntu running on my Windows 7. Getting there.

Very excited :)

To clear the stuff that's written there (also called "prompts" written in the "shell" ;) ), you just type "clear" and hit enter.

Summary
    
    You can scroll through your command history with the Up and Down arrow keys.
    The root directory (/) contains all of the folders and files on your computer.
    Your home directory (~) is the directory where your terminal always starts.
    
    Basics
    ======
    echo      echo prints text to your terminal. --> echo Hello World
    clear     clear will clean up your terminal.
    cd        Use the cd command to change your working directory.
    pwd       The pwd command will print the working directory.
    ls        The ls command will list files and folders in a directory.
    
    Create, change or show folders and files
    ==========================
    mkdir     Use mkdir to create new directories.
    touch     The touch command creates empty files.
    >         You can use > to redirect the output of a command into a file.
    >>        will append command output to the end of a file.
    ATTENTION: if you use > on a pre-existing file, it will simply delete 
              everything already written and replace it with the new stuff.
    cat       Print a text file to the command line using cat.
    wc        Inspect properties of a text file with wc. The wc command displays
              the number of lines in a file followed by the number of words and 
              then the number of characters.
    head      Peak at the beginning of a text file with head. head -n 4 will show the first 4.
    tail      Peak at the beginning of a text file with tail. tail -n 4 will show the last 4.
    less      Scroll through a large text file with less.
    nano      nano is simple text editor. Directions how to use it are shown when opened.
    
    Move, Copy, Remove
    ==================
    mv        can be used for moving or renaming files or folders. Move like that: mv [filename] [name of folder].
              if [name of folder] doesn't exist, the file will be renamed and then have the name of the folder. 
              This only works within folders. If you want to move a file to a folder that is up one, the shortcut is .. 
              --> mv test.txt ../ OR try the absolute path: mv test.txt ~/FolderName/SubFolder/  
              For example, you have Home/Documents/text.txt and you are standing on Documents (it's your working directory)
              So you do: mv text.txt ../ will move the file to the home folder.
    cp        can copy files or folders.
    rm        You should try to avoid using rm which permanently removes files or folders.
